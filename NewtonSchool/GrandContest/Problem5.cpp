/*
Problem Statement
You are given Q queries. In each query, determine whether there exists an array A of size N such that:

1. All the elements are positive integers.

2. The number of subarrays such that their XOR-sum is 0 is exactly K. In other words, there are exactly K pairs of integers (l, r) such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N and Al ⊕ Al+1 ⊕ ... Ar = 0.

If there exists such an array, print "YES", otherwise print "NO".
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer Q — the number of queries (1 ≤ Q ≤ 105).
Q lines follow, each line containing two space separated integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) and K (1 ≤ K ≤ N(N+1)/2).
Output
For each test case, print "YES", if there exists such an array, otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).

Note that the output is case sensitive.
Example
Sample Input
3
2 2
3 2
2 1

Sample Output
NO
YES
YES
