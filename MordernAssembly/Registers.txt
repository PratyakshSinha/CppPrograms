Types of 16 bit registers

General purpose registers - Although general purpose register has a special function but they can also be used by us for storing and using information

AX - AX is the primary accumulator 
BX - base register can be used for indexed addressing
CX - count register can be used to store the loop count in iterative instructions
DX - data register

AL can be used to access lower byte and AH can be used to access Higher byte of the AX register this also remains true for other 3 registers


Pointer register - 

IP - Instruction Pointer 
SP - Stack Pointer
BP - Base Pointer


Index registers - 

SI - Source Index
DI - Destination Index


Control registers are just flags

There are segment registers also present but we no longer use segmented memory so they are pointless


Important point - all of the programs in this file were made in Visual Studio and had bunch of other files with them as well. I just pasted the main cpp and main asm file from the projects.

Thank you very much
